section (Deprecated),map section (Deprecated),"A unit of extent of cartographic resource that is a scale representation of a vertical surface (commonly a plane) displaying both the profile where it intersects the surface of a celestial body, or some conceptual model, and the underlying structures along the plane of intersection (e.g., a geological section).
