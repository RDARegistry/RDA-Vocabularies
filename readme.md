# RDA Registry

This branch contains the pages for the [RDA Registry](http://www.rdaregistry.info/). The Registry provides labels, definitions, and other metadata for derefernced HTTP IRIs of [RDA](http://www.rdatoolkit.org/) (Resource Description and Access) classes, properties, and value vocabularies. The Registry also provides mappings and alignments to other element sets and vocabularies, along with other content. The Registry is maintained by the [RDA Steering Committee](http://www.rda-rsc.org/).

Dereferencable content, maps, and alignments are generated from the most recent release of RDA Vocabularies. A complete [ZIP](https://github.com/RDVocab/RDA-Vocabularies/zipball/master) or [TARBALL](https://github.com/RDVocab/RDA-Vocabularies/tarball/master) release of RDA Vocabularies may be downloaded at any time. 

If you have an issue, please visit the project [issues](https://github.com/RDVocab/RDA-Vocabularies/issues) 
and post it there.
